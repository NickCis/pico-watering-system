    # Y2036 fix
    #
    # The NTP timestamp has a 32-bit count of seconds, which will wrap back
    # to zero on 7 Feb 2036 at 06:28:16.
    #
    # We know that this software was written during 2024 (or later).
    # So we know that timestamps less than MIN_NTP_TIMESTAMP are impossible.
    # So if the timestamp is less than MIN_NTP_TIMESTAMP, that probably means
    # that the NTP time wrapped at 2^32 seconds.  (Or someone set the wrong
    # time on their NTP server, but we can't really do anything about that).
    #
    # So in that case, we need to add in those extra 2^32 seconds, to get the
    # correct timestamp.
    #
    # This means that this code will work until the year 2160.  More precisely,
    # this code will not work after 7th Feb 2160 at 06:28:15.
